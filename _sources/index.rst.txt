Introduction
============

Dox supports software developers to write **requirements**, **architecture** and **software design**
for their projects. All specification elements can be linked to each other and to source code to get
a full **traceability**.

Dox is the combination of the stand-alone Ruby gem **dim** and the three Python extensions for
`Sphinx <https://www.sphinx-doc.org/>`_ **dox_style**, **dox_util** and **dox_trace**.
