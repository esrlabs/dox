Installation
============

Install the Dim gem. The version argument is optional. If not specified, the latest
available version will be installed.

.. code-block:: text

    gem install dim-toolkit
    # or
    gem install dim-toolkit -v 1.2.3

Verify the installation. The version is needed you have multiple Dim gems installed
and want to execute a specific version.

.. code-block:: text

    dim --version
    # or
    dim _1.2.3_ --version

.. note::

    Specifying the version with `-v 1.2.3` or `_1.2.3_` is not a Dim feature, it's provided by Ruby
    itself.
