p1,PR1,Incorrectly treated command line arguments will lead to unpredictable behaviour.,"In most cases wrong command line arguments will lead to an error, which means Dim terminates with an exit code != 0. In many cases the user will recognize if Dim is doing unexpected steps like formatting instead of exporting, or using a different export output format. Reviews are mandatory. Tested by unit tests.",":file:`options_spec.rb`, |br|:ref:`Integration Guide Verifier <integration_verifier>`, |br|:ref:`Integration Guide Export <integration_export>`"
,PR2,"No options are set, Dim is not executing the intended steps.","Dim requires some arguments to be set. If not written into the options data store, the program will raise an exception when trying to access the `options` data store which leads to an exit code != 0.",:ref:`Workflow Execute Subcommand <workflow_execute_subcommand>`
p2,PR1.1,"Files are loaded incorrectly, not loaded completely or wrong files are loaded.",In most cases syntax and consistency checks within the loader will recognize the errors and Dim will terminate with exit code != 0. Otherwise the data store `data` will get incorrect data. This can often be recognized by the user or latest by the reviewer in a code review tool. Reviews are mandatory. Tested by unit tests.,":file:`loader_spec.rb`, |br|:file:`requirement_spec.rb`, |br|:file:`consistency_spec.rb`, |br|:ref:`Integration Guide Verifier <integration_verifier>`, |br|:ref:`Integration Guide Export <integration_export>`"
,PR1.2,Files do not exist.,"If files do not exist, Dim will terminate with an exit code != 0. Tested by unit test.",:file:`loader_spec.rb`

p3,PR1.1,The formatter changes the `Input files` incorrectly or writes incorrect `Separately stored formatted input files`.,In most cases this is recognized by the user or latest by the reviewer in a code review tool. Reviews are mandatory. Tested by unit tests.,":file:`format_spec.rb`, |br|:ref:`Integration Guide Verifier <integration_verifier>`"
,PR1.2,The exporter produces wrong files or writes them to  a wrong location.,"In most cases this is recognized by the user or latest by the reviewer in a code review tool.

,PR2.1,The formatter does not write the output correctly or the format options are not processed correctly.,In most cases this is recognized by the user or latest by the reviewer in a code review tool. Reviews are mandatory. Tested by unit tests.,":file:`format_spec.rb`, |br|:ref:`Integration Guide Verifier <integration_verifier>`"
,PR2.2,The exporter does not write to `Exported files`.,Non-existing `Exported Files` will lead to an error in the verifier. Reviews are mandatory.

,PR2.3,The built-in stats are not printed to the console.,Recognized by the user. Statistics reviews are mandatory. Tested by unit tests.,":file:`stats_spec.rb`, |br|:ref:`Integration Guide Statistics <integration_stats>`"
p4,PR1,The exit code is set to a value != 0.,An exit code != 0 indicates an error. A verifier will reject the commit. In almost every unit test the exit code is checked.,:ref:`Integration Guide Verifier <integration_verifier>`
,PR2,The exit code is not set explicitly. A value != 0 is used by the underlying Ruby or OS framework.,An exit code != 0 indicates an error. A verifier will reject the commit. In almost every unit test the exit code is checked.,:ref:`Integration Guide Verifier <integration_verifier>`
p5,PR1,The exit code is set to 0.,In almost every unit test the exit code is checked.,See unit tests.
