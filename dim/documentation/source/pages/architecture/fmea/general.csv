Error ID,General Error Description,Measures
"DF1, DF2, DF3",Data is corrupted or lost during file access or wrong files are accessed.,This tool runs without network access or memory queues. It is assumed that underlying layers like Ruby or the OS are qualified. Potential issues with data are analyzed in "Data storage" and "Processing" elements.
DF4,"Every data store type exists only once in the system, e.g. ""Input files"" cannot be stored in ""Exit code"".",Trying to do something like this will lead to a program exception. Dim will terminate with an exit code != 0.
PR3,"Dim has no strict timing constraints and has no concurrently running threads, so it cannot run too fast. However, a too slow execution might frustrate the user, so that the user removes the mandatory check on the code review tool.",It's mentioned in the integration guideline of Dim that the :ref:`verifier <integration_verifier>`  from the code review tool is mandatory and must not be removed or skipped.
CF1,A complete stop of the control flow is usually no problem for a tool which runs offline and not on the target hardware. Dim is used for verifying changes on a code review tool. A stopped or terminated Dim check due to timeout must not lead to a merged commit.,"It's mentioned in the integration guideline of Dim that the :ref:`verifier <integration_verifier>`  from the code review tool must exit successfully, otherwise the commit must be rejected."
CF2,This is a very generic problem and can lead to random errors.,"The likelihood is reduced to a minimum by intensive unit tests. To ensure that enough unit tests are written, the code coverage is 100%."
