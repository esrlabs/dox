Dynamic Behaviour
=================

.. _workflow_main:

Main
----

This is the base workflow:

    Main workflow

Notes:

- Not all subcommands require to load files, e.g. for printing the version.
- If any action fails, the exit code is set to 1 instead of 0.
- Exceptions are not caught. If a Ruby application terminates abnormally, the exit code is set to
  a value != 0 depending on the exception type.

.. _workflow_parse_options:

Parse Options
-------------

.. figure:: ../../_static/swa/dynamic/options.drawio.png
    :scale: 100%
    :align: center

    Options

The outcome of this workflow can be either:

    - An option was found which causes the tool to gracefully exit immediately, e.g. after
      printing the license.
    - Parsing failed, e.g. something is missing, invalid or inconsistent.
    - All options successfully loaded and stored globally.

.. _workflow_loader:

Load Files
----------


.. figure:: ../../_static/swa/dynamic/loader.drawio.png

    Loader

| **Load**:
| If a filename was specified in the options, this *loader* workflow is executed. The file can be
  a config file or a requirements file. A config file can refer to one or more requirements files.

| **Store**:
| Loaded requirements are harmonized, which means not specified attributes will become empty
  strings. This makes further processing easier.
  The result of this harmonization is called *original data* and stored in the loader instance.
  It is used by e.g. the *format* subcommand. Afterwards the default values get resolved and are set
  for empty attributes if applicable.

| **Check:**
| At the end the consistency is always checked, independently from the subcommand.

.. _workflow_execute_subcommand:

Execute Subcommand
------------------

.. figure:: ../../_static/swa/dynamic/subcommand.drawio.png
    :scale: 100%
    :align: center

    Subcommands

This part of the program flow is straight forward. Depending on the command line options, the
appropriate subcommand is executed. Invalid subcommand options were already handled in
:ref:`workflow_parse_options`.

.. _workflow_check:

Subcommand "check"
------------------

This subcommand is just a dummy and completely empty. The consistency check is always done when
:ref:`loading <workflow_loader>` the files.

.. _workflow_export:

Subcommand "export"
-------------------

.. figure:: ../../_static/swa/dynamic/export.drawio.png
    :scale: 100%

    Exporting requirements

The files are exported to a specific output **folder** in a specific **type** specified with
command line options. A **filter** can be specified to export only a part of the requirements.
Files like images listed in the `enclosed` attribute of the input file are also copied to the output
folder.

The algorithm is always the same, but internally different implementations of the ExporterInterface
(see :ref:`dim_classes`) are called depending on the type which can be RST, JSON and CSV.

.. _workflow_export_rst:

RST
+++

Requirements are exported to Sphinx so that the `dox_trace` extension of Sphinx can understand the
content and generate a nice HTML view.

This is the only export type where an index file is generated (with the Sphinx `toctree` element).

.. _workflow_export_json:

JSON
++++


This exporter simply uses the Ruby JSON library to convert the requirement objects to JSON objects
which can be written to the output folder.

No index file is written.

.. _workflow_export_csv:

CSV
+++

The requirements are converted to a CSV format.

No index file is written.

.. _workflow_format:

Subcommand "format"
-------------------

.. figure:: ../../_static/swa/dynamic/format.drawio.png
    :scale: 100%
    :align: center

    Formatting input files

The following types of formatting are possible:

- ``in-place``: See use case :ref:`use_case_change_requirements`.
- ``check-only``: Executed from the verifier in the :ref:`Version Control System <use_case_vcs>` use
  case.
- ``extra``: A debugging feature to write to separate files instead of changing the input files
  directly.
- ``stdout``: similar to `extra`, but writing the output to the console.

.. _workflow_stats:

Subcommand "stats"
------------------

.. figure:: ../../_static/swa/dynamic/stats.drawio.png
    :scale: 100%
    :align: center

    Printing statistics

This subcommand prints generic statistics of the requirements specified in the input files
like number of total number of requirements and number of accepted or rejected requirements.

.. _workflow_schema:

Subcommand "schema"
-------------------

.. figure:: ../../_static/swa/dynamic/schema.drawio.png

    Generating dynamic JSON schema

This subcommand generates dynamic JSON schema of the requirements specified in the input files.
