p1,PR1.1,Cache is not prepared properly which could lead to undefined behaviour.,"- If the cache is not prepared properly, subsequent read and write calls will result in exceptions due to missing data structures which means Sphinx is terminated with exit code != 0.
- The verifier executes a complete build to avoid problems with incremental builds.","- Cache access is implicitly tested by almost every test case.
- :ref:`Integration Guide <integration>`"
,PR1.2,The version is not determined correctly which  may lead in using incompatible cache data.,"This is only relevant if the extension is updated.

- It's likely that an exception occurs due to incompatible cache data.

p2,PR1.1,Files are loaded incorrectly or not loaded completely.,"- In most cases syntax and consistency checks within the loader will recognize the errors and Sphinx will terminate with exit code != 0.
